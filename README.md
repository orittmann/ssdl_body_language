### Computationally Analyzing Politicians' Body Language Using Pose Estimation

This repository accompanies the [MZES SSDL](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/socialsciencedatalab/) Workshop on October 16th, titled "Computational Analysis of Politicians' Body Language Using Pose Estimation."


### Timeline of the workshop

  1. **Input talk**: We will start with a 10-minute input talk. You can find the slides under `slides/slides.pdf`.
  2. **Hands-on coding session:** Our coding session will comprise two parts. First, we will work with python to apply pose estimation to our videos. Second, we will switch to R to explore and analyze the resulting data
    
        - **Applying pose estimation in python**: First, we will implement the pose estimation on two short videos of speeches in the German Bundestag. We will do so by using Google Colab. You open the Colab notebook by following this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/orittmann/ssdl_body_language).
        - **Analyzing pose estimation data in R**: Once we worked through the python code in Google Colab, we'll go back to R and explore the resulting data. You can find the respective code in `script.Rmd`.
